# MarketPlace-Outstanding-DashBoard

***Problem Statement:***

The marketplace team receives a detailed Excel file on a monthly basis, containing comprehensive data about products available in the marketplace along with their payment details. This file includes various information such as:

Order dates\
Settlement amounts\
Charges to be incurred, including:\
   TDS (Tax Deducted at Source)\
   TCS (Tax Collected at Source)\
   Shipping fees (including tax)\
   Commission fees (including tax)\
   Other deductions
   
The team requires a dashboard to efficiently track and analyze this data. The key functionalities needed for the dashboard include:

**Monthly Payment Summary:** Display the total amount of payments received for each month.\
**Outstanding Amount:** Show the outstanding amounts for each month.\
**Detailed Breakdown:** Provide a detailed view of deductions, fees, and charges per order.


***Solution:***

* Developed an automated dashboard solution for the Marketplace team to process payment details from various e-commerce platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, Tatacliq, Myntra, etc.
   
* Utilized BigQuery and SQL queries to transform unstructured data from Excel sheets into a structured format.
   
* Created a user-friendly dashboard displaying the details of orders placed by customers on other e-commerce partnerâ€™s platform to know the exact costing and selling price. 
   The dashboard also includes details like outstanding amounts, order description, Tax deductions, and settlement status.
